# Youtube-data
A python scraper to extract data of any YouTube channel using Google YouTube Data API v3

This program gets data from a youtube channel and returns all its information which is stored in database.<br><br>
**You will need an API key**<br>
You can get an API key for free if you have a google account.<br>Here's how to get an [API key](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started). This free key has limit of 10000 requests per day. You can see the [cost of each request](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/determine_quota_cost) made.<br>
We can change the channel id and to get information of some other channel by changing/omiting few functionality that were made specific for this channel.<br>
While making the request we can change the part of it such as snippet, content details, etc. to get the data we want<br>
I highly recommend you to check out the [official document](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs) for more information.<br><br>
Hope this helpsðŸ˜€
